## What is it
I am busy implementing the Language Server Protocol so [Templ](https://templ.guide) has support for better code completion than current LSP. The goal it to support html, htmx and normal templ syntax and to be able to provide code completion for all of them.

The language server is written in go. Mainly to challenge myself to learn go. Coming from a Typescript background.
